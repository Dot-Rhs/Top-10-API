#Top 10 Chart API

---

We've made an API that can get information based on the Top 10 Singles chart.
You can get info on which artist is at which position, which album and contains
an image related to the artist/album.

You can access the whole Top 10 by using **https://localhost:3500**

You can look for an specific chart position by using **/artist/insert-number-here**.
For example, **https://localhost:3500/artist/1** for chart position 1!
